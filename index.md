Title

Project management best practices with virtual teams: A review

Abstract

The rise of information and communication technology provides project teams the choice of working remotely. This literature review explores the following questions: Under what circumstances should remote teams be utilized? What costs and benefits are presented by remote project work? When working remotely, what best practices can help ensure a successful project delivery?

## Introduction

High speed internet access has become broadly available over the past few decades[pew-internet]. As of 2015, 67 per cent of American adults had access to high speed internet at home, up from only 1% in 2000. This expansion has helped fuel the growth of remote work. From 2005 to 2009, the number of employees who worked from home grew 61% in the US, and is poised to grow even more in the future[telework-trends]. Even without further growth, remote work is already an important consideration in successful project management.

How can project managers best utilize remote teams? Before embarking on a project with remote teams, project leaders should analyze the costs and benefits of the available remote work options relative to colocated alternatives for their specific project. Such an analysis should assume remote work best practices are followed.

Project leaders should then use the results of this analysis to decide whether or not to utilize remote teams. If remote teams are utilized, project team members should work dilligently to ensure remote work best practices are followed in order to extract maximum value from this decision.

## Integrating Remote Teams into Projects: An Overview

Integrating remote teams into projects can be accomplished by performing the following five activities:

  1. Define the set of feasible remote and colocated project team composition options. 

  2. Map this set of options to their distributions of costs and benefits.

  3. Select a set of options that have acceptable distributions of costs and benefits.

  4. Integrate these selections into the project management plan.

  5. Implement these selections.

### Define Feasible Team Composition Options

The set of feasible remote and colocated team composition options must first be defined before any analysis, selection, integration, or implementation of such options can be performed. The options to be defined may range from few to numerous and simple to complex depending on the size and complexity of the project under consideration.

These prospective options will also be constrained by various factors. For example, organizational policies, resource availability, cultural and linguistic preferences, internet accessibility, office space availability, and talent availability may all constrain the set of prospective options. The options defined for further analysis should respect these constraints and represent plausible alternative arrangements of remote and colocated team compositions for the project under consideration.

Broadly speaking, these options will reside somewhere along a spectrum ranging from a single highly colocated team to a fully distributed remote team.

### Map Options to Costs and Benefits

Once defined, the set of feasible team composition options must be mapped to its distributions of costs and benefits. Some of these costs and benefits will be project specific, while others will be similar across projects. This paper provides a collection of costs and benefits that are commonly accrued over various projects.

### Choose Acceptable Options

After the costs and benefits of each option has been established, project leaders must select those options they consider acceptable. This set need not be limited to a single option -- project leaders may decide that a range of options is consistent with a successful project.

The criteria by which the set of acceptable options is chosen will be highly context specific. It is up to project stakeholders to determine what factors to prioritize when making their selections.

### Integrate Acceptable Options into Project Management Plan

Once the set of acceptable team composition options has been selected, it must be integrated into the project management plan. 

This integration takes place primarily within the project planning process group and the project human resource management knowledge area; however, significant work will also be required throughout almost all knowledge areas.[pmbok]

### Implement Options

The final step of integrating remote teams into a project is to implement the remote team provisions of the project management plan. This implementation takes place primarily within the executing and monitoring and controlling process groups, and across almost every project management knowledge area.

## Costs of Remote Teams

Summary of costs

### Ostensibly Reduced Productivity

Teasley et. al. suggest that radically co-located software teams are more productive than other team configuration formats.[radical-co-location] The authors of this study ascribe the success of radical co-location primarily to the benefit of having all team members within immediate proximity of one another for communication purposes. This implies that because remote teams experience distance as a barrier to face-to-face communication, they will tend to underperform more co-located teams.

### Reduced Team Visibility



### Reduced Engagement

Employees that work from home more than 2.5 days per week appears to harm 

### Reduced Work Environment Control
### Time Zone Differences

## Benefits of Remote Teams

Summary of benefits

### Ostensibly Increased Productivity
### Increased Work-Life Balance
### Increased Documentation and Formalization of Communication
### Expanded Talent Pool

Labour from lower-cost areas.

### Reduced Commuting

## Remote Team Best Practices

Summary of best practices

### Invest in team-building
#### Get face-to-face time

Options include employee retreats, mandatory in-office days for telecommuters, 

#### Play games together
Pick something synchronous, online, multiplayer, accessible across skill levels and devices, with co-operative team play, with voice communication. Play once a day.

#### Utilize Videoconferencing

Videoconferencing is the next-best alternative to face-to-face communication for remote workers. Teammates who communicate via videoconferencing build trust nearly as well as face-to-face teams.[cmc-trust]

### Adopt the best tools
#### Support Productive Remote Work Environments
 - Options range from providing standard equipment, discounted team stores, partnerships with office productivity/ergonomics firms, 
### Prioritize effective communication
