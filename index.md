Title

Project management best practices with virtual teams: A review

Abstract

The rise of information and communication technology provides project teams the choice of working remotely. This literature review explores the following questions: Under what circumstances should remote teams be utilized? What costs and benefits are presented by remote project work? When working remotely, what best practices can help ensure a successful project delivery?

## Introduction

Over the past few decades the internet has become highly accessible[pew-internet]. As of 2015, 67 per cent of American adults had access to high-speed internet at home, up from only 1% in 2000. This expansion has fuelled the growth of remote work. From 2005 to 2009, the number of employees who worked from home grew 61% in the US, and is poised to grow even more in the future[telework-trends]. Even without further growth, remote work is already an important consideration in successful project management.

Before embarking on a project with remote teams, project leaders should analyze the costs and benefits of remote work options relative to colocated work alternatives for their specific project. Such an analysis should assume remote work best practices are followed. This literature review presents common costs and benefits to remote work for the purpose of such analyses.

Project leaders should then use the results of this analysis to decide whether or not to utilize remote teams. If remote teams are utilized, project team members should work dilligently to ensure remote work best practices are followed so as to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of this decision.

## Integrating Remote Teams into Projects: An Overview

Integrating remote teams into projects can be accomplished by performing the following five activities:

  1. Define the set of feasible remote and colocated project team composition options. 

  2. Map this set of options to their distributions of costs and benefits.

  3. Select a set of acceptable distributions of costs and benefits, and, by extension, of acceptible project team composition options.

  4. Integrate these selections into the project management plan.

  5. Implement these selections.

## Define Feasible Team Composition Options

The set of feasible remote and colocated team composition options must first be defined before any analysis, selection, integration, or implementation of such options can be performed. The options to be defined may range from few to numerous and simple to complex depending on the project under consideration. 

The prospective options will be constrained by many factors. For example, organizational policies, resource availability, cultural and linguistic preferences, internet accessibility, office space availability, and talent availability may all constrain the set of prospective options. The options defined for further analysis should respect these constraints and represent plausible alternative arrangements of remote and colocated team compositions for the project under consideration. 

### Map Options to Costs and Benefits

The set of options defined in step one must then be mapped to its distributions of costs and benefits. Some of these costs and benefits will be project specific, while others will be similar across projects. This review only considers costs and benefits that are likely to be similar across projects.

### Choose Acceptable Options

Once the previous has been completed, project leaders must select a set of acceptable options. This set need not be limited to a single option -- project leaders may decide that a range of options is consistent with a successful project.
